    <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Many cultures around the world have their own version of the popular flan dessert. This version is my mom's famous Vietnames flan cake, which is always a hit at family gatherings. It is delicate and silky smooth, and contrasts well with the caramelized sugar syrup.

                <ol>
                    <li>Make the caramel by cooking sugar and water in a pot on medium low heat. Take off the stove once it is a dark golden colour. Quickly pour it in your baking pan.</li>

                    <li>In a large pot, combine the cream, milk and sugar. Cook on medium heat until the sugar has melted and the mixture is warm.</li>
                    <li>Slowly ladle the mixture into the eggs and mix. Once everything is combined, put it through the sieve a few more times.</li>
                    <li>Add vanilla and rum and mix.</li>
                    <li>Pour everything into the baking pan. Bake in the oven with a water bath for 30 minutes at 350 F. </li>
